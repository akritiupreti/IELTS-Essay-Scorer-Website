                <h3>Sample Topic:</h3>
                <p id="sampleTopic">Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some
                    people think that an interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are
                    other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
                </p>
                <h3>Sample Essay:</h3>
                <p id="sampleEssay">It is undeniable that most companies rely on interviews for hiring new employees,
                    but some people believe that this dependence on interviews is wrong and that other alternatives
                    should be preferred as they are better. I believe that interviews are a reliable method, and the
                    other methods cannot be considered more effective.

                    There are many reasons why interviews are suitable for hiring new employees. Firstly, through the
                    interview, the recruiters can get an idea about the personality and social skills of the potential
                    employees. In interviews, there is face-to-face interaction, and the candidates have to answer
                    impromptu questions, from which personality traits can be judged. Also, by asking some case
                    study-type questions, employees can judge traits like the ability to handle pressure, confidence and
                    the ability to think outside the box.

                    In addition, although there are many other methods for hiring, none of them could be considered
                    superior to interviews. One the other common method is the written test, which is good to judge the
                    theoretical knowledge of the person. However, this method cannot give a good idea about the
                    personality of the candidate. By contrast, through interviews, employers can judge both the
                    knowledge and temperament of the potential employee. Moreover, the written test is fallible to
                    cheating as sometimes candidates can take outside help.

                    Another selection process is a group discussion, which is good where a major job requirement is
                    conversational and persuasion skills for instance sales jobs. They are really not suited for
                    technical jobs because these are not customer oriented. On the other hand, interviews hold good for
                    any type of job as the interviewer can frame questions to test the particular skills they require.

                    To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the preference for interviews for hiring among employers
                    is justified as interviews have advantages over other commonly adopted methods.
